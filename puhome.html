<p>Bismillah Ir Rahman Ir Rahim. Project Ummah is an initiative which aims to inform the masses on Islam and its beauty. We take purely from
    the Qur'an and Sunnah. I would like to mention that this website is solely for the sake of Allah SWT. We indeed created this 
    website in order to serve the Deen and to make it easier for the world to get a hold of halal services in just a click. 
</p>
<p>Please utilise this website in a correct manner and share it to those who could benefit InShaaAllah. I would also like to ask
    you to keep the entire Ummah in your dua's. We are in testing times and the best way we can aid one another is through dua. 
</p>
<p>We are currently planning on releasing updates every few months in order to keep the website fresh and responsive. We also plan 
    to release more webpages onto this site to allow you to gain as much benefit as you can InShaaAllah. 
</p>
<p>We always respond so contact us through the listed contacts that are mentioned in the Contacts page.</p>
<p> Jazkallah Khairun for your time, May Allah Jalla Jalalahu keep you protected, Ameen.</p>
