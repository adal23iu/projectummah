        <p>An explanation of what Islam really is:</p>
        <p>Islam is a monotheistic religion that was founded in the 7th century in the Arabian Peninsula. Its followers, called Muslims, believe in one God (Allah in Arabic) and that the prophet Muhammad was his final messenger.

            The core beliefs of Islam include the belief in one God, the belief in the prophets of God including Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, the belief in the holy book of Islam, the Quran, and the belief in the Day of Judgment and individual accountability for actions.
            
            Muslims follow the Five Pillars of Islam which include the declaration of faith (shahada), prayer (salah), fasting (sawm), giving to charity (zakat), and making a pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) at least once in a lifetime.
            
            Islam also has a strong emphasis on social justice, compassion and helping those in need.
